# Kittens

A modern hook and abstraction layer for Minecraft, powered by Felis.

## Changes
The philosophy of this repo is: "allow everything as long as it makes sense".
In other words, refactoring already existing APIs, adding new APIs(ignoring degree of complexity), or removing APIs, is allowed as long as nothing gets too crazy.

Don't expect to be removing kittens from day to day, or removing old methods immediately.

However do make suggestions. They will be taken into consideration.
